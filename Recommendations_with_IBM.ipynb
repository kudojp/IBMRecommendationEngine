And if we assume that these users do not revisit the articles they already read in the training set, then we can say that there is no common 1 values in user-item-train and user-item-test. We make svd factorization. As we increase the number of latent features, what we get is actually the exact user-item-train values of these 20 users. There is no prediction about new 1 values in test set. Accuracy is high due to the high number of zeros common in these two matrices. It is kind of naive predictor in spam email classification, like we say there is no spam email and the accuracy of this prediction turns out to be very high. Here we say all users read no new article and we get accuracy above 90% since there are a lot of common zeros in two matrices . To me it does not make sense at all. Can I learn what you think about this? Any help appreciated.`\n",

Increasing the number of latent features just means that factorization would be closer to the train data set, and it would make accuracy worse because once the reader read an article, they won't usually visit there again."
